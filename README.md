# Expense Tracker

A Flutter based application that lets you track your expenses, set budgets and more. Comes with a first release APK.

## Features

The app comes with a number of robust features to streamline your money management, and also generates in depth reports about your spending with a number of customizations. The major features include:

### 1. Setting a monthly budget and sources of income
You can set a monthly budget and add sources of income to track your income and expenses effectively. This allows you to effectively track all the spendings.

### 2. Adding and tracking expenses
You can add and track your expenses, categorize them and also add tags to make it easier to group the spending and also view an overall log of where money has been spent.

### 3. Setting debts
You can set debts with other people, be it if you owe them money or they owe you. With a simple UI, you can add or remove people along with their debts.

### 4. Viewing reports
All of the expenses, debts and income sources can be viewed as one in the reports section with timely reports being made available to the user as and when required. This creates an excel workbook with multiple sheets of required data.

### 5. Resetting expenses
With the previous data exported (or when needed), the data can be reset to allow the user to start over fresh.

## Future plans
The app is still in its early stages and there are a number of features that are planned to be added, with main ones including notification tracking to make the expenses adding more easy.
